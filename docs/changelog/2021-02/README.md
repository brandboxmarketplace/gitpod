## Synchronize Theia user settings with VS Code

We recently launched [support for VS Code](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/#vs-code).

If you switch your editor to VS Code, your user settings and extensions configured in Theia will be synchronized with VS Code automatically when you start a new workspace.

**Interested in using VS Code as your default editor?**

You can define VS Code as your default editor in the _Feature Preview_ section in your [Gitpod Settings]().

## Deploy Gitpod in an air-gapped network

You can now [self-host Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted/) in a network that is isolated from the internet. Additional details on this feature are available in [PR #3228](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/3228).

_What is an air-gapped network?_: [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) answer that question in detail.
